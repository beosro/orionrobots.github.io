# Returns and replacements

Do not send items back without having contacted us first at customer.services@orionrobots.co.uk.

If you have any trouble with your robot or product, please talk to us, we are very keen to get all of our customers building with confidence. We will assist you and test your items to ensure they work and get your robot moving as soon as possible.

We are happy to do this for up to 6 months after shipping the robot to you.

If for any reason you are missing a robot part for an order with us - please inform us and we will ship out the missing part as soon as we can.

If your robot or order appears to be damaged - first contact us to verify the damage, and we will refund or replace as necessary. 

Unassembled robots can be returned to us within 60 days for a refund of the items (upon safe receipt of the robot).

To be eligible for a return, your item must have ALL the parts and in the same condition that you received it.

# Refunds (if applicable)

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval of your refund.

If it is approved, the refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 30 days. 

# Late or missing refunds (if applicable)

If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. 

Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.

Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
