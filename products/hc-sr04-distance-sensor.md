This is a simple but capable distance sensor - able to sense a 30 degree range, using 2 IO pins on your microcontroller.

Like all the products on the Orionrobots shop - this requires no soldering to get it working, and it comes with 4 simple hookup cables to connect it directly to the Arduino so you can get trying distance measurement really quickly. It uses 5v logic.

Contents:

* The HC-SR04 Sensor board
* A ribbon of 4 male-female breadboard connectors.

This is what can be done with 2 of these, a few spare bits and an Explorer 1 kit:
