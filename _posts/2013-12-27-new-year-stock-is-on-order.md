I've ordered in the new stock - refreshing all the robot kits and trying out some new exciting items like a speech control module, some variants on the Arduino compatible or other microcontroller boards and writing up about how the robot can be converted for Raspberry Pi support.

And these kits will all be usable without soldering at all!
