Hi, posting on behalf of Gabriel, one of the orionrobots club attendees. This is a Bionicle style CD 
holder/rack created in Lego by Gabriel - admittedly he was supposed to be making components for a Great Ball Contraption- but inspiration can come from anywhere.

It does actually hold CDs - either on the tail rod, or they can be stacked against the head.
