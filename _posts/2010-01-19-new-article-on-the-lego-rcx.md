<div class="postbody-content">
 <p>
  Since I have written plenty on the Lego RCX, I have decided to distil the many different articles into one article in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/collected-info-on-the-lego-rcx" >
   The Lego RCX, Inside and Out
  </a>
  contains info on programming one, buying one, adding your own sensors and powered devices, opening the RCX up, getting the RIS software and IR tower working on newer OS's and I will be collecting up and adding more in the next few weeks.
