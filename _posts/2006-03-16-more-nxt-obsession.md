I have come across another interesting [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit") blog at <a href="http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/">http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/</a>.

It is updated regularly, and has made a number of interesting observations about the kit and bot itself.

I will certainly be reading it, and of very great interest is the most recent announcement: <a href="http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-from-vacation-and-mdp.html">http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-from-vacation-and-mdp.html</a>

The author, Jim K, of Atlanta, has been accepted into the [MDP](MDP "The Mindstorms Developer Panel"). So we may expect to hear much more interesting info from him. There are already a number of tasty tidbits about the system there.

Coupled with <a href="http://legoeducation.typepad.com/">http://legoeducation.typepad.com/</a>, which is an official [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy") blog which I have referred to before, and <a href="http://news.lugnet.com/robotics">Lugnet Robotics</a> , there is a growing surge of information, and very likely a coming surge of interest in robotics at its release as was evident with the original [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer").

Stayed tuned - its all about to get very much more interesting.
