title: NXT's have started shipping, and arriving
---
 <p>
  It seems that the
  [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy")
  [Mindstorms](MindStorms "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego")
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  kit started shipping last week and have now started arriving. However, there may be a fair backlog as all the preorders go out.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am waiting rather intently for mine and maybe I will finish the Lathe I am building using the
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  as opposed to the
  [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer")
  +
  [PIC](PIC "PIC")
  combination I was originally planning - the ability to get feedback on the motors positioning may simplify its design by a huge amount.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will be putting work in progress photos of the programmable lathe up soon, so readers can actually see what I am on about here.
