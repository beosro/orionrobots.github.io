title: Steven King Animatronics prop on Ebay
---
 <p>
  An
  [animatronic](animatronic "animatronic")
  head prop used in the Steven King miniseries "Rose Red", has been placed on ebay.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not fully working, but some robot builder or Steven King fan may be able to 
  do something with it. It is a fairly gruesome sight, and the eBay page even 
  includes a video of the thing in action. In fact it is positively creepy.
 </p>
 <p>
  This sounds like an interesting project for someone to get their teeth into. 
  I have seen a number of amusing and interesting animatronic projects recently, 
  including the story of one fellow who was making an animatronic chicken for a 
  school play from an RC Car.
