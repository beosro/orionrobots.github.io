The arrival of Lego mindstorms kicked off a wave of Lego innovation, but not all of that used official Lego mindstorms kits - some where just motors strapped onto curious contraptions, some of the most interesting being the Rube Goldberg devices, kinetic sculptures, rolling ball machines and similar.
