title: Sounds great on the NXT
layout: post

John Hansen, an avid [Lugnet](Lugnet "Lego Users Group Network") and [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy") user has created a whole raft of top utilities for converting audio files to formats that can be used on the [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit").

Whats more, they are open source, and hosted with the Bricxcc suite of tools.

Among them are tools to convert a midi file to an NXT melody file with the .rmd extension, which can be renamed to rso files to be played back on the NXT. This, alongside a tool to convert wav files to rso files, and a tool to play back the rmd files makes for a good sound suite.

These utilities add to an already neat set of [OSS](OpenSourceOSS "Open Source Software") tools, like BrickTool - which can deal with both the [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") and NXT, NeXTTool which is a suite designed for communicating with the NXT via Fantom and of course the Bricxcc Lego developer [IDE](IDETool "Integrated Development Environment") itself.
