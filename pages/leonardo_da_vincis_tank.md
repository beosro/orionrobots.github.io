title: Leonardo Da Vincis Tank
---
Leonardo Da Vinci once designed a tank. Although never built, it was ahead of its time.
It had radial outward facing guns - for attack.
The top section could be separated from the other(presumably for vision).

The wheels were very thin - arguably too thin without any tracks to have been useful.
Also in Leonardo's drawings, it appears that the crank would be turning the wheels against each other
- in opposition.
But despite this - he was still many years ahead of the competition. And looking at these sketches,
and knowing Leonardo - there may have been more up his sleeve than we will ever know.

It was made of wood, and would have been extremely difficult to move - making it an easy target for hurled or machine
launched weapons and artillery. Had it been made of metal - it would have offered better protection -
but been completely impossible to move. Had steam engines been usable for locomotion in his time, Leonardos tank
would have been a winner. The basic principle was at least sound.
