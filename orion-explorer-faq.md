<strong>Q: What does solderless mean?</strong>

A: The user will not need to use a soldering iron to assemble any of the solderless kits. They can be assembled using simple plug-in pins, or screw terminals. I've nothing against soldering - but for someone new to robotics, or for the constructively lazy, it is easier not to need to. I generally reserve it for repairing, or prototyping something completely new.

<strong>Q: Will it work on Carpet?</strong>

A: Yes - it will run fine. On lower batteries it prefers hard surfaces though.

<strong>Q: What ground clearance does it have? Can it cross gaps?</strong>

A: It will happily go over 12mm high obstacles, but will struggle at 20mm. The wheels have this much clearance - but now it is a matter of torque - so maybe only on a new set of batteries. It can happily cross gaps of 30-50mm.

<strong>Q: Does it come preprogrammed?</strong>

A: Only with the Arduino bootloader and a simple LED flasher. For it to move - you'll need to use one of the tutorial code demos.

<strong>Q: Are the other sensors and outputs for it? </strong>

A: The digital input/output pins are compatible with the sensors and devices that can be found on our site, and many on the internet. It is capable of working with I2c, Serial and Spi devices.

<strong>Q: Does it work with standard Arduino shields</strong>

A: Yes - it is a 100% Arduino compatible controller (apart from the bare option), however note that it will need connections for the motors and power - if the shield uses and does not extend these IO pins you'll need to rethink the wiring.

<strong>Q: Can you ship it to my country?</strong>

A: We can ship to most of the world - using either Airsure, or courier services. Mainland UK is free, others will be priced accordingly. We have shipped to Australia, US, Canada as well as Uk and Europe destinations.

<strong>Q: Is there any cover or case I can buy for it?</strong>

A: Not currently - but it is something planned if there is enough demand for it.

<strong>Q: If my robot is broken - can I fix it myself?</strong>

A: Yes - <a href="/2013/12/23/all-our-robots-are-user-serviceable">all the robots are user serviceable</a>. They're made of replaceable parts you put together yourself. It designed to be user maintainable and so you could repair or upgrade it.
